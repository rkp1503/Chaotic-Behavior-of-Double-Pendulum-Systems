\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
What we have done is derived the necessary equations that capture the behavior of the Double Pendulum system using simple mathematics, energy laws, and Lagrangian Mechanics. Using the code provided, we were able to solve the system of equations that captures the motion of the Double Pendulum system. Then, we were able to show that the Double Pendulum system is a chaotic system by showing that the behavior will change from a slight change in initial conditions.
